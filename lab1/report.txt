We have run all the experiments using an initial w value with all zeros. Once a value of x, say x_i is checked, x_(i+1) is checked next, regardless of whether x_i fails in the perceptron test.

We keep a count of the number of inputs the current perceptron passes and when it is equal to the total number of inputs (indicating that the prediction is correct for all x_i), we return th   e final weight vector. Once the current perceptron fails, we reset the number of correct inputs for the new one to zero.

(a) NAND:
    Final w value = [-4,-3,-2]
    Converged in 34 steps
    Number of updates made = 18

    NOR:
    Final w value = [-1,-2,-2]
    Converged in 21 steps
    Number of updates made = 9

(b) XOR:
    Does not converge. It repeats in a cycle of size 4 given below:
    0 0 0 
    1 0 0 
    0 0 1 
    -1 1 1

(c) 5 input palindrome:
    Does not converge. It repeats in a cycle of size 16 given below:
    2 -1 -1 0 1 1 
    1 0 -1 1 1 2 
    2 0 -2 0 1 1 
    3 0 -2 0 0 0

    1 -1 1 1 2 1 
    2 -2 0 0 1 1 
    1 -1 0 0 1 2

(d) 5 input majority:
    Final w value = [7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]
    Converged in 196 steps
    Number of updates made = 41

(e) 6 input parity:
